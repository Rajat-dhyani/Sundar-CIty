# Sundar-CIty
Our goal is simple, Lets make every city of the Indians, by the Indians and for the Indians!

## Inspiration
When we talk about making Indian city Smart, the first think that comes to our mind is the bad condition of Indian roads, garbage dumps, breakage of sewer systems and poor conditions of government offices. To me if we really want to make our Indian city smarts we need to first start from grounds up.

## What it does
To solve this issue, i present you <strong>The Project Sundar City</strong>. It is a go to website for any Indian citizen to complain about ill conditions of road and garbage dumps on the road. 

What's unique is you are guaranteed  to get response from government officials.  The task are scheduled on priority basis according to how many user have reported the same condition of that particular issue and how our inspectors have judged the condition of the issue.

You will also be getting updates of the work in progress and its completeness. And finally you can submit your feedback on the work that has been done and get a chance to be featured in our website.

## How I built it
I have used PHP as back-end and HTML, CSS and Bootstrap as front-end tool.

## Challenges I ran into
Being a single member team i had to be as efficient as three member teams(Other participants) and that i think was one of the challenges that i faced. Other than that i struggled on how i can cover all the issues and don't go overboard with it.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
I am proud of the fact that i have completed all the core features of the website. Including user dashboard, admin dashboard and inspectors dashboards.

## What I learned
How to be efficient and manage time.

## What's next for SundarCity
There is plethora of things that can be added to it like extending it from not only cities but also to villages and in future and i will sure add it.
